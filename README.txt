INTRODUCTION
------------

MAGPIE is a machine learning-based analysis tool for the confidence assessment of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in human plasma samples, identified by immunoprecipitation coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (IP-MS/MS). This algorithm constructs a class-balanced training dataset of likely high-confidence putative PPIs and examples of non-specific protein binding. A logistic regression classification model is trained and used to assign probabilities of being a bona fide interaction to putative PPIs. The performance of this classification is evaluated by implementing a leave-one-control-out (LOCO) cross-validation strategy to compute false discovery rates for the assigned probabilities. MAGPIE was tested using spectral count data from ten IP-MS/MS produced in Dr. Benoit Coulombe's lab at the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montr√©al (IRCM).


DEPENDENCIES
------------

 * Python version 3.7+ (download: https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 * Scikit-learn version 0.24.0+ (download: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)


RUNNING MAGPIE
--------------

1. Download the MAGPIE package.
	1.1 Save the package to your desired location (e.g., your home directory).
	1.2 Use the path, accordingly, to access the package.
2. Prepare your input files as described below.
	2.1 Save your input files to the same directory as magpie.py.
3. Open a terminal (Mac/linux) or command prompt (Windows).
4. Navigate to where the MAGPIE package is stored.
5. Run the command:

	python3 magpie.py [experiment_file] [control_file] [Z-score_threshold]

Note: The specified Z-score threshold will be used to label the likely high-confidence PPIs to be used as positive training examples. We recommend starting with a Z-score threshold of 3.


INPUT FILES
-----------

MAGPIE requires two .CSV files as input, one for experimental data and one for negative control data, BOTH with the following formatting:

 * Row 1: Names of proteins targeted by IP antibodies, preceded by a column name for the protein purifications, such as "Preys"
 * Column 1: Names of proteins purified in the IP-MS/MS runs
 * Column 2 and on: Spectral count quantification of purified proteins in a given IP-MS/MS run (non-normalized, as MAGPIE normalizes the counts as per its methods)

Toy example:

	 Preys | Bait 1 | Bait 2 | Bait 3 ... Bait n
	--------------------------------- ... -------
	Prey 1 |  1032  |  1001  |  1100  ...  1270
	--------------------------------- ... -------
	Prey 2 |  876   |  786   |  897   ...  658
	--------------------------------- ... -------
	Prey 3 |  68    |  75    |  232   ...  139
	  ...     ...      ...      ...   ...  ... 
	Prey m |  36    |  126   |  24    ...  63


OUTPUT FILES
